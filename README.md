# Face Verification for Passport Ownership
>This repository contains the implementation of an automated system for verifying passport ownership by analyzing and matching a claimant's face with the photograph on their passport personalization page. The system employs the Viola-Jones algorithm for face detection and uses Eigenfaces with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction.

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   cd CS554_Project
---

## Installation

- You need to install the following dependencies in Python3 for this project:
   ```bash

## Usage Instructions
### Running Viola-Jones Detector
- Use the `VJ_Final.py` script to execute the Viola-Jones Detection part. 
   ```bash
   python VJ_Final.py

 
### Running Eigenfaces
- Use the `eigenfaces.py` script to execute the face verification. 
   ```bash
   python eigenfaces.py

## Dataset Description  

### Viola-Jones Face Detection  
- **Dataset**: WIDER FACE.  
- **Details**: 10,000 examples, equally split between 5,000 positive (faces) and 5,000 negative (non-faces) samples.  
- **Split**:  
  - Training set: 8,000 images (80%).  
  - Testing set: 2,000 images (20%).  

### Eigenfaces  
- **Dataset**: MUCT Dataset (for training) and AT&T Faces (for testing).  
- **Split**:  
  - Training: 30 individuals (~300 images).  
  - Validation: 4 individuals (~40 images).  
  - Testing: 6 individuals (~60 images).  

### Active Appearance Models (AAM)  
- **Dataset**: MUCT Dataset.  
- **Split**:  
  - Training: 30 individuals.  
  - Testing: 10 individuals (~400 total images).
